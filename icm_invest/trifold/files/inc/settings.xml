INTEGRATED CAPITAL MANAGEMENT... WE BRING LIFE INTO FOCUS. At iCM Investment Management is what we know... but it isnt who we are. We are husbands wives fathers sons  daughters. We are skiers crosstters cyclists golfers  little league coaches. We are chauffeurs Band-Aid applicators and jesters for the enjoyment of 3 year-olds. We understand that investments are more than just money they are hopes dreams  futures as well as pasts and presents. We live life. We understand. Investors should seek the advice of their nancial advisor prior to making any changes to their investment strategy or purchasing any securities. Investors should note that there are risks inherent in all investments such as uctuations in investment principal. Past performance of any index investment or strategy cannot be relied upon as a guarantee of future results. There is no guarantee that a diversied portfolio will outperform a non-diversied portfolio in any given market environment. No investment strategy such as asset allocation can guarantee prot or protect against loss in periods of declining values. In general bond markets are volatile bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect is usually pronounced for longer-term securities. Any xed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to a substantial gain or loss. Investments in stocks of small companies involve additional risks. Smaller companies typically have a higher risk of failure and are not as well established as larger blue-chip companies. They involve investment risk including possible loss of principal amount invested. Investment return and principal value may uctuate so that the investment when redeemed may be worth more or less than the original cost.

Many investors both individual  institutional experience subpar results with their investment programs because they focus on the wrong thing. Investors tend to focus on return and ignore risk until it is too late. This leads to two damaging consequences. iCMs investment process is a manifestation of our investment philosophy. That is our belief system should be apparent in the implementation of our portfolio. Risk is not a single-dimensional challenge but a multi-dimensional one. Most investors and for that matter most investment providers overlook this. As a result they stop short of having a true grasp on total portfolio risk. At iCM risk management is in the truest sense of the phrase knowing what you own better than anyone else. Visit us at icm-invest.comleft-braininvestment or scan here to learn how we can help you avoid these  other traps. Visit us at icm-invest.comleft-brainunderstanding or scan here to learn more about our complete approach to risk management. It is this depth of knowledge that is our commitment to every investor and by virtue of this understanding you as our client can have greater insight knowing we are on your side. INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY PHILOSOPHY is crucial to your SUCCESS as an investor it is essentially the ROADMAP BLUEPRINT or even GENETIC CODE of an investment program. It is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence to be ever in view and which should be true and appropriate in all times and situations. They presented him with the words And this too shall pass away. Likewise when presented with a similar challenge we venture the motto VALUATIONS MATTER.

Any persons life told truly is a novel. -Ernest Hemingway To us each of these novels is in and of itself a unique work of art that documents our own journey on this adventure called life. We wont lose sight of that and dont want you to either because the journey is as important as the destination. With BIG DREAMS JOURNEYS  ASPIRATIONS come real emotional attachment. It is also this emotional attachment that keeps us going allowing us to commit real blood sweat  tears to accomplishing goals and seeing our dreams become reality. At iCM we bring a UNIQUE and PRINCIPLED approach that offers investors an uncommon experience a clear one. The anxiety many investors feel from time to time is not always driven just by the result but the path that is being taken. Investors intuitively understand that markets do not always just go up and the road to their goals will have some bumps. It is the I dont know component of investment strategy that leads to real issues along the path to the end destination. It is the elimination of the I dont know anxieties that iCM strives for by delivering a CLARITY of PURPOSE. By working with iCM investors will know exactly how decisions are made as well as how we will behave in both good markets and bad. Any persons life told truly is a novel. Ernest Hemingway It is this uncommon clarity that is our commitment to every investor... and by virtue of this clarity every investor can sleep more peacefully at night knowing that we are on your side. </text></Page>
