Investors should seek the advice of their nancial advisor prior to making any changes to their investment strategy or purchasing any securities. Investors should note that there are risks inherent in all investments such as uctuations in investment principal. Past performance of any index investment or strategy cannot be relied upon as a guarantee of future results. There is no guarantee that a diversied portfolio will outperform a non-diversied portfolio in any given market environment. No investment strategy such as asset allocation can guarantee prot or protect against loss in periods of declining values. In general bond markets are volatile bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect is usually pronounced for longer-term securities. Any xed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to a substantial gain or loss. Investments in stocks of small companies involve additional risks. Smaller companies typically have a higher risk of failure and are not as well established as larger blue-chip companies. They involve investment risk including possible loss of principal amount invested. Investment return and principal value may uctuate so that the investment when redeemed may be worth more or less than the original cost.
