338 vs Other Fiduciaries ERISA Section 321 ERISA Section 321  Denes the broad duties of a plan duciary. For the purposes of investment selection ERISA allows for Plan Sponsors to complete their Plans investment selection on their own or hire an advisor or investment manager to assist them by providing suggestions analysis reports andor specialized tools. These advisors and investment managers are considered to be Section 321 co-duciaries. While the advisor and investment manager serve as co-duciaries this does not relieve the Plan Sponsor of its duciary responsibility for the selection and monitoring of the investments offered within the Plan. These advisors are only responsible for the suggestions they make and the analysis they provide. They are not responsible for the ultimate outcomes since the Plan Sponsor still maintains nal decision making authority and ultimately the liability that goes with it. ERISA Section 338 Under this arrangement an investment manager accepts authority to manage acquire and dispose of investment options. The investment manager acknowledges in writing that they are a duciary with responsibility and accountability for the selection of the investments offered within the Plan. ERISA Section 405d provides that under a 338 arrangement the Plan Sponsor andor Trustees of the Plan are not liable for acts or omissions of the 338 investment manager and are under no obligation to any investment or to otherwise manage any asset of the plan which is subject to the management of that investment manager. A 338 arrangement represents the highest level of investment liability transfer possible under ERISA from the plan sponsor to the investment manager.
